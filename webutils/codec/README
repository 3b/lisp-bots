This is Codec, a sans-serif font in a single height in BDF format for
use with the X Window System.  This font is expressly designed for
reading and editing program source code, rather than for text, and it
has some slightly unusual quirks arising from this design -- for
example the full-stop is centred vertically (looks nice for structure
selection in C/C++ and for decimal points; looks rubbish in text), and
the underscore rests on, rather than under, the baseline.

The font has a 15-pixel height and uses the ISO-8859-1 Western Europe
encoding.  This archive contains proportional (codec), monospaced
(codec-terminal) and monospaced-condensed (codec-terminal-narrow)
variants, and a version of codec-terminal with the traditional
uncentred full-stop (codec-text).  Apart from codec-text, all variants
have identical glyphs; only the spacing differs.  Suitable XLFD names
for your fonts.dir configuration are given in the BDF files and a
sample fonts.dir is included.

These fonts are copyright 1998 Chris Cannam.  You may copy, edit and
redistribute Codec, provided that the complete archive including this
README file is made available with each distribution, that the
original copyright is preserved, and that any alterations are
documented in this file.
